/**
 * Phalcon\Mvc\Model
 *
 * Phalcon\Mvc\Model connects business objects and database tables to create a
 * persistent domain model where logic and data are presented in one wrapping.
 * Its an implementation of the object-relational mapping (ORM).
 *
 * A model represents the information (data) of the application and the rules to
 * manipulate that data. Models are primarily used for managing the rules of
 * interaction with a corresponding database table. In most cases, each table in
 * your database will correspond to one model in your application. The bulk of
 * your application's business logic will be concentrated in the models.
 *
 * Phalcon\Mvc\Model is the first ORM written in Zephir/C languages for PHP,
 * giving to developers high performance when interacting with databases while
 * is also easy to use.
 *
 * ```php
 * $robot = new Robots();
 *
 * $robot->type = "mechanical";
 * $robot->name = "Astro Boy";
 * $robot->year = 1952;
 *
 * if ($robot->save() === false) {
 *     echo "Umh, We can store robots: ";
 *
 *     $messages = $robot->getMessages();
 *
 *     foreach ($messages as $message) {
 *         echo $message;
 *     }
 * } else {
 *     echo "Great, a new robot was saved successfully!";
 * }
 * ```
